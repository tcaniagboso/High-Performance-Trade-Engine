Main Components of a Trade Engine

Think of it as layers:

1. Order Entry & Validation

Accepts incoming requests (BUY, SELL, CANCEL, etc.).

Checks if the request is valid (e.g., order size > 0, client has funds).

2. Order Book

The data structure that stores outstanding orders:

Bid side (buyers): sorted highest → lowest.

Ask side (sellers): sorted lowest → highest.

Provides fast lookup for the best bid/ask.

3. Matching Engine

The heart of it — decides when an order can be matched.

Applies rules like price–time priority:

Best price first.

Oldest order at that price level first.

Handles partial fills, cancellations, and leftover orders.

4. Trade Execution

Once a match is found:

Record the trade (price, size, time).

Update or remove filled orders.

Generate execution reports (confirmations to participants).

5. Market Data Feed

Publishes events:

Book updates (best bid/ask, depth changes).

Trade events (last price, volume).

This is what external traders and market makers subscribe to.

6. Risk & Compliance (later stages)

Prevents overspending/shorting without collateral.

Ensures regulatory compliance, fair access, and system auditability.
